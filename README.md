# Project description
This is a repository for a project @ Heidelberg University. The goal was to reprocude findings from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914820303026 on a publicly available dataset. Code and Findings can be found in the jupyter notebooks. 

Inital dataset can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/4048312#.YVBQQn1CSUk



### Side notes

We edited the notebooks in GoogleColab and therefor uploaded the public dataset to our GoogleDrive and mounted it into the Colab Books. To execute the code, either adjust the directory and file paths or upload the public dataset to a folder called COUGHVID in your GoogleDrive aswell.
